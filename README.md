## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- clamp() functions

### What I learned
A good way to make text size responsive is by using the `clamp()` function.  
It has following syntax: 
`clamp(min font size, preferred font size, max font size)`

You can use a calculator like [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) to help you find good values for the parameters.
